  <h1>End of week 2 journal</h1>
  <p>Overall this week was way harder than last week. I really enjoyed the first set of challenges we had. It was
    challenging but was able to look up all of it to figure out. I feel like I did really good on the rock, paper,
    scissors game. It totally helped how I made comments for everything I wanted to do first and then went back and
    added the code in. Thursday doing the second set of challenges got really frustrating as was not able to find the
    answers for it online. Everything I had tried was not working. Went home super discouraged. Wish we had a chance to
    go over it as a class as we might have the same questions. Excited but nervous for this first project we have to do
    over the weekend.</p>
